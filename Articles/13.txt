Recognizing the critical importance of high-quality surveillance data, the World Health Organization (WHO), in collaboration with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF), UNICEF, Gavi and Crown Agents, has embarked on a strategic initiative to improve Ministry of Health and Child Care (MOHCC) data quality at provincial and district levels. This initiative aims to equip healthcare workers with the necessary skills and knowledge to generate, analyze, and utilize surveillance data effectively, leading to significant improvements in public health outcomes."
"2" "Zimbabwe’s Expanded Programme on Immunization (ZEPI) has faced significant hurdles in data quality, which adversely affected effective decision-making and disease control efforts. Issues such as inaccurate line lists for disease outbreaks, inconsistencies in epidemic identification (EPID) numbers, and suboptimal reporting of adverse events following immunization highlighting the critical need for improved data management within the country’s health systems."
"3" "WHO’s on-the-job mentoring programme is designed to provide hands-on training to healthcare workers in real-world settings. By working alongside experienced mentors, health workers gain practical experience in data collection, reporting, and analysis. This approach not only enhances their technical skills but also fosters a culture of continuous learning and improvement within healthcare facilities."
"4" "Key components of the mentoring program include tailored training sessions, where mentors assess the specific needs of healthcare workers and deliver customized training that addresses identified gaps in knowledge and skills. In addition, health workers are also guided in reviewing and validating data as it is collected, reinforcing the importance of accuracy and attention to detail. Continuous feedback is provided to reinforce learning and identify areas for further improvement, ensuring that health workers feel supported and empowered."
"5" "WHO has been instrumental in enhancing the EPI programme in Zimbabwe through provision of technical and financial support. Working closely with the MOHCC and key partners including UNICEF, BMGF and Crown Agents, this collaboration has not only strengthened the capacity of local health authorities but has also ensured that the data generated is reliable and actionable."
